### Why Learn java ?

This general-purpose language was designed to be easier to use than C++, which was a notoriously complex language.
90% of the Fortune 500 companies have since used Java to develop desktop apps and website backend systems.

Java is a highly portable language as it must be executed through a cross-platform compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).Furthermore,
Android apps are also developed using Java since the Android Operating System runs on a Java language environment.

### Community

Community size is important because the larger a programming language community is, the more support you'd be likely to get.
As you step into the programming world, you'll soon understand how vital support is, as the developer community is all about giving and receiving help.
Moreover, the larger a community, the more people will be building useful tools to make development in that particular language easier.
